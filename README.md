## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  About me
### I'm 21 years old, I live in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, and I'm a beginner in the programming area. I do system analysis and development. My interest in the field began with a curiosity about how technology works. After that, my friends recommended some courses where I had my first contact with algorithms. Later, I took a web development course, where I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. During a period of uncertainty about which area to pursue, I became interested in data analysis. <br> ‚ú® My hobbies include playing instruments, drawing, watching movies/series, and going out with family or friends.
